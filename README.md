# Pokedex Project

This is my first React Project after learning HTML, it has been a great opportunity to expand
my coding knowledge and learn the basics of Javascript and React. It was a real challenge and a good introduction
to React features such as hooks, props and mapping.

This project was created using HTML, JS and
CSS and the API used was https://pokeapi.co/.

## Features

The app allows users to search for Pokemon by name as well as being able to
generate a random Pokemon using the "Random Pokemon" button. It then displays the stats
of the Pokemon as well as the affiliated Sprites. There is also a toggle switch that allows the user
to toggle between Shiny/Non Shiny sprites at their leisure.

It also features a gradient background that is animated, it changes colours
based on the Pokemon type such as grass, psychic etc. Furthermore, it features a loading screen when the Pokemon is
loading
and also produces an error message if the Pokemon is not found.
